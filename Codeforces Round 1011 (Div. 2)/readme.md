## Codeforces contest
I had one of the wrost contest in my personal life. i couldn't even solve one problem in that the problems are listed below.

# A [Serval and String Theory](https://codeforces.com/contest/2085/problem/A)
The fisrt problem was easy one but I didn't implement it correctly and as the time passed I lost confidence and forgot the problem itself.
# B [Serval and Final MEX](https://codeforces.com/contest/2085/problem/B)
i didn't want to continue so i dropped the contest....
# C [Serval and The Formula](https://codeforces.com/contest/2085/problem/C)

# D [Serval and Kaitenzushi Buffet](https://codeforces.com/contest/2085/problem/D)

# E [Serval and Modulo](https://codeforces.com/contest/2085/problem/E)

# F2 [Serval and Colorful Array (Hard Version)](https://codeforces.com/contest/2085/problem/F2)
