## Codeforces Contest Experience

I had one of the worst contests of my life—it felt like everything that could go wrong did. I couldn't solve even a single problem during the contest, and here's how it went:

### Problems Faced  
**A [Serval and String Theory](https://codeforces.com/contest/2085/problem/A)**  
The first problem was straightforward, but my implementation was incorrect. As time passed, I lost confidence and even forgot the problem entirely.  

**B [Serval and Final MEX](https://codeforces.com/contest/2085/problem/B)**  
I was so discouraged after my struggle with Problem A that I decided to drop the contest altogether.  

**C [Serval and The Formula](https://codeforces.com/contest/2085/problem/C)**  
𝑎+𝑏 = (𝑎⊕𝑏) + 2 × (𝑎&𝑏), is vaild for any two number. so if the number is a + b = a ⊕ b then it can be seen that the 2*(a & b) == 0.

but the solution was implented using dp so i am skipping these. 
Going to learn BIT manipulation and DP next.
**D [Serval and Kaitenzushi Buffet](https://codeforces.com/contest/2085/problem/D)**  

**E [Serval and Modulo](https://codeforces.com/contest/2085/problem/E)**  

**F1 [Serval and Colorful Array (Easy Version)](https://codeforces.com/contest/2085/problem/F1)**  

**F2 [Serval and Colorful Array (Hard Version)](https://codeforces.com/contest/2085/problem/F2)**  

### Post-Contest Reflections  
Although the contest didn’t go well, I took time afterward to understand the problems properly. I’ve since made progress and uploaded the solutions to the repository.
